## IV. Story

There was once a great warrior on a distant planet who served in his country's military for many years. He nobley fought in many wars and demonstrated his gifted talents of battle every time. He was faster, stronger, and smarter than everyone he fought and fought with. He worked day and night to improve his skills to defend the country he greatly loved. He was eventaully promoted to commander and led his troops to many successful battles. A general took notice of his skills and how fast he was progressing through the ranks which greatly worried him about his position in the military. Out of fear of losing his power, the general issued that the warrior be executed for committing highly illegal actions. The warrior was shocked as he had never done anything but fight for his country in any way he could. He was then thrown into the gladiator arena with nothing more than a simple sword, some armor, and a bow. If he could survive the countless waves of merciless creatures that would be sent at him and prove that he is a true gladiator, he would forgiven for his actions. The warrior must fight harder than he ever has before if he wants to survive and see the next day. 

The theme behind gladiator is to allow the player to progress their warrior in the way they want to play the game. If a player really enjoys slashing with a sword, they will be able to do so and upgrade their sword along the way. If there is enough time for me, I'd like to incorporate magic into this game so the player can cast spells as well as slash and shoot enemies.

The mood of gladiator is more of a cartoon style with fantasy elements incorperated into it. For example, the creatures that the player will fight won't be anything from this planet. They will be made-up fanasty monsters that have different attributes and abilities. 

The player progresses through the game by defeating waves of enemies and building their warrior. After each wave, the player will have the ability to upgrade equipment, buy new equipment, and buy potions to heal and improve other stats. The plot is driven the further the player makes it through the arena by new and different enemies being sent at him. 

The motivation behind Gladiator is for the player to build the ultimate warrior to complete the arena. After each wave, the player is able to upgrade equipment, armor, and buy potions with the gold he earned from the enemies he defeated from the previous wave. This gives the player something to work towards if they want to buy the best sword in the game to see the kind of damage it can do. As the player builds his warrior, he will be able to defeat bigger and stronger enemies. Eventaully, the player will have a really strong warrior that will be fighting very strong creatures.

## V. Esthetics

### Graphics
Gladiator will have a more catoony style of graphics like that of Clash Royal and other supercell type of games (except this is just 2D).

### Sounds
There will be regular sound effects based on player actions. There will also be looped background music as the player progresses through the game.

### Types of Sounds
When the player swings his sword, there will be a *swoosh* sound as well as a bow shooting sound when the player shoots his bow. Monsters will have their own sound effects as well for their actions. There will be little fun UI sound effects for buying things as well as in the menu. Background music will be catchy and fun for the player to play the game too.

## VI. Gameplay

### Teaching the Game
The game will have a small tutorial for new players if they wish to play it to find more information about the game. It will be a simple introduction to the game and it's mechanics in regards to killing enemies, using equipment and buying new equipment.

### Player Learning
Gladiator will have a small learning curve for most players. The game is simple in that it's a classic slash and shoot style of game. Kill the enemies, collect gold, buy new and better stuff, progress. In order for players to get good at the game (skill) it will involve the player getting use to the game mechanics with how enemies work, what they do, how to beat them, when to strike and when not to, ect. Players can also improve their skill level by knowing what upgrades they should buy when based on how they want to play the game and set themselves up. The main way to be good at gladiator is timing though in terms of when to strike an enemy and knowing what that enemy will try to do to you, the player.

## VIII. Other

Gladiator plans to be a casual, addicting game that players can either pick up for 5 minutes or 5 hours. The motivation for the player to play the game differently with different upgrades and kill enemies in different ways to maybe become more successful should work well. Gamers love being able to build their character in a way they want to and making him more powerful along the way is even better.
